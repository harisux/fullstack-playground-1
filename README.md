# fullstack-playground-1

## Brainstorming

### General project idea
- Personal learning 
- Practice solution of a same set of problems across different technologies
- Just a playground but with some common structure
- Get to compare and practice different backend solutions
- Able to fetch & choose different backend from frontend

### Architecture
- Headless architecture / platform agnostic ?
- Domain driven to isolate a common problem to compare upon
- A common set of API / contracts
- Middleware to check availability of backend options, discovery?
- Common build / deployable, docker?
